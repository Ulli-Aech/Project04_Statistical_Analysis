## Project Description
  
This project is part of the Ironhack data analytics bootcamp. The goal of this project was to perform statistical analysis on a given dataset. The goal is to identify the most important features of houses that affect the sales price.
  
## Dataset
  
The analysis are based on the Housing prices dataset from this source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data  The data in the train.csv file contains data that describes (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa (US) and their sales prices. In the data_description.txt is a brief description of the kind of data that the different columns contain.
  
## Workflow

- After downloading the dataset and importing it into a jupyter notebook, I started with familiarizing my self with the given data and tried to get a general overview 

- I analysed the column with Sales Prices and started to think about what data could have the moszt impact on the sales price of a house

- After investigating the correlation of two different columns on the sale price column, I started building a linear regression model. 

- From there on I added different columns, analysed the impact of the added data to the model and decided weither to keep the data in the model or not. 

- In the end I had created a model that represents 78.2% of all sales prices from the dataset

## Organization
  
The repository contains a directory with the CSV files and a directory with the jupyter notebook.
